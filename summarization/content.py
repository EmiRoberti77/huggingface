Retail sector in the UK

The retail sector is going through a prolonged period of upheaval. Factors such as changing consumer behaviour, increased internet shopping and challenging economic conditions are changing the way retailers operate and engage with their customers. The coronavirus pandemic has added to these challenges accelerating trends such as increased online shopping and adding economic challenges through lockdown restrictions.
This briefing paper describes the current state of the retail sector in the UK using data and recent reports on the industry. Sometimes due to data availability, data refers to Great Britain only. This briefing covers the retail sector only (not the wholesale sector) and does not provide information on government policy in the retail sector.
Key figures
• Retail sector economic output was £97.0 billion in 2020, 5.2% of the UK’s total economic output and a 2.5% fall on 2019.
• There were 3.0 million jobs in the retail sector in 2019.
• There were 310,000 retail businesses as of 1 January 2020
In 2020, retail sales in the Great Britain were worth £437 billion, down 0.6% on 2019. For every pound spent in 2020:
• 41 pence was spent in food shops – a 7% rise on 2019
• 9 pence was spent in clothing shops (including textiles and footwear) – a 25% fall on 2019
• 8 pence was spent on automotive fuel – a 25% fall on 2019
• 8 pence was spent in household goods shops (including electronics and furniture stores) – a 1% rise on 2019
Impact of the pandemic on retail sales
At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, retail sales fell dramatically as lockdown restrictions closed non-essential retail stores. Retail sales as a whole recovered to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020 before falling slightly again as non-essential retail closed over the winter. Sales recovered strongly in April 2021 with the reopening of non-essential retail.
Different types of retail stores have had very different experiences during the pandemic, with sales in clothing stores and fuel seeing the most significant falls during 2020.
Internet sales
Internet sales have been rising since 2008 (when ONS data began) reaching around 20% of all retail sales in Great Britain in 2019. Online sales rose sharply at the onset of the pandemic as physical stores were closed and have remained over 28% of all sales since.
Store closures
In 2020, 54 retail companies with multiple stores ceased trading, affecting 5,214 stores and 109,407 jobs according to the Centre for Retail Research (note that this should not be interpreted to mean that this many jobs have been lost). This is the highest number of store closures since 2008 and 2009 following the financial crisis.
4 Retail sector in the UK
The Local Data Company found that 15% of retail premises in Great Britain were vacant in the second half of 2020, up from 13% in the second half of 2019. This was the biggest rise in store vacancies since 2013.

1. The retail sector in the UK: definition and statistics
1.1 Definition of the retail sector
The retail sector includes any business or individual involved with selling products directly to consumers. The retail sector includes shops, department stores, supermarkets, market stalls, door-to-door sales people and internet retailers.
Related sectors include the wholesale sector (which supplies retailers), the logistics sector (which connects wholesalers and producers with retailers), and the manufacturing sector (which produces the products sold by retailers). This briefing paper focuses on the retail sector only.1
Retail stores are an important part of high streets and town centres. However, it is important to note that the retail industry is broader than just sales on the high street. The statistics in this briefing represent the whole retail sector including in shopping centres, retail parks and online sales.
For further discussion about high streets, see our briefing: Town centre regeneration (21 May 2021).
1.2 Economic contribution of the retail sector
Summary:
• Retail sector economic output was £97.0 billion in 2020, 5.0% of the UK’s total economic output and a 2.5% fall on 2019.2
• There were 3.0 million jobs in the retail sector in 2019.3
• There were 310,000 retail businesses as of 1 January 2020.4
Economic output
The economic output of the retail sector in 2020 was £97.0 billion, which was 5.2% of the UK’s total economic output.5
Retail sector economic output fell by 2.5% in 2020 compared to 2019 following the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The economic output of the sector returned to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2020. Output fell again in the first quarter (Q1) of 2021 to

Over the past ten years, the retail sector’s economic output has largely followed a similar path to the whole economy.
The retail sector saw a fall in economic output and then weak growth following the financial crisis and subsequent recession of 2008, until late 2012. In 2013, the sector began to recover and grew strongly from 2014 until late 2016.
1.3 Employment
Employment in the retail sector in the UK was around 3.0 million in 2019, 9.3% of the UK total. This was a fall of 11,100 (0.4%) compared to 2018 (over the same period, total employment in the UK grew by 1%).6
Employment in the retail sector is fairly evenly distributed across most regions and countries of the UK, shown in the following chart.
London had the lowest proportion of retail employment in 2019 (7.5% of jobs in London were in retail) and Northern Ireland had the highest (11.5%). The South West and North East also had around 11% of employment in retail.

Impact of the pandemic on retail employment
According to the Centre for Retail Research, an academic-led research institute, 109,407 retail jobs could be affected by retail companies going into administration in 2020.7 This figure is higher than the Centre reported for 2008 following the financial crisis. The Guardian also kept track of job losses announced across a number of high street brands during the course of 2020, the largest being 13,000 redundancies across Arcadia (brands such as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfidge) and 12,000 redundancies at Debenhams.8
As of 31 March 2021, 536,300 retail jobs were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which makes 19% of eligible jobs in the sector.9 Over half of these (56%) were in ‘other specialised stores’ which includes clothing and footwear stores.
1.4 Businesses
There were 310,120 retail businesses in UK retail sector as of 1 January 2020, 5.2% of all businesses.10

In common with most other sectors in the economy, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) made up over 99% of retail businesses.
However, the retail sector and the whole economy had differing proportions of businesses in other business size categories.
• 59% of businesses in the retail sector had 0 employees (single person-led business), compared with 76% in the economy as a whole.
• 35% of businesses in the retail sector had between 1 and 10 employees, compared with 19% in the whole economy

2. Retail sales in Great Britain
In 2020, retail sales in the Great Britain were worth £437 billion, down 0.6% on 2019. For every pound spent in 2020:
• 41 pence was spent in food shops – a 7% rise on 2019
• 9 pence was spent in clothing shops (including textiles and footwear) – a 25% fall on 2019
• 8 pence was spent on automotive fuel – a 25% fall on 2019
• 8 pence was spent in household goods shops (including electronics and furniture stores) – a 1% rise on 2019
The remainder was spent in other types of shops, non-specialist shops, or in non-store retailing, such as market stores, catalogues and online-only retailers.11
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the volume of retail sales had been increasing year-on-year since 2013. This followed a period of stalled growth in sales following the financial crisis, between 2008 and 2013.
The following chart shows how the volume of retail sales has changed over the last two decades (that is, sales adjusted for inflation).12 Only rarely have retail sales fallen in volume terms compared to the previous year since 1997. Average growth in rolling three month periods compared to the previous year was 2.0% between 1997 and 2021.

10 Retail sector in the UK
Coronavirus pandemic: impact on sales
At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, retail sales fell dramatically as lockdown restrictions closed non-essential retail stores.
Retail sales as a whole recovered to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020 – relatively quickly compared to other sectors such as hospitality and entertainment.13 Sales fell again in January and February 2021 when non-essential retail shut again, however the fall was much less significant than early 2020, suggesting that retailers and consumers had adapted to restrictions.
Although retail sales overall have broadly returned to pre-pandemic levels, there has been a big difference between the impact on different store types, shown in the chart below.
